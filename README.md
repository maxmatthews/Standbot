# Standbot
A Slackbot designed to run an SCRUM standup meeting

You'll need to add your slack usernames to the slackbot_settings.py file as well as
an incoming webhook URL and the token from an outgoing webhook from slack.

Please message me if you have any questions with setup. Forking is highly encouraged!

Also, if anyone wants to write a better readme, I won't stop you!
